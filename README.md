## Scientific question: 
Since the immunization with M. vaccae NCTC 11659 prevented stress-induced increases in IL-6 protein or IL6 mRNA expression in mice, is it possible that M. vaccae NCTC 11659 can prevent stress-induced increases in human IL-6 protein?

## Scientific hypothesis :
If the human IL-6 protein is similar to the murine IL-6 protein, the M. vaccae NCTC 11659 may be able to prevent stress-induced increases in IL-6 protein or IL6 mRNA expression in humans.
